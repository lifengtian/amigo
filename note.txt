what if I change 'package main' to 'package mypkg'
and go run mypkg.go?
cannot run non-main package

Method
type Vertex struct {
    X, Y float64
}

func (v *Vertex) Abs() float64 {
    return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

Type
type Abser interface {
    Abs() float64
}

func main() {
    var a Abser
    f := MyFloat(-math.Sqrt2)
    v := Vertex{3, 4}

    a = f  // a MyFloat implements Abser
    a = &v // a *Vertex implements Abser
    a = v  // a Vertex, does NOT
    // implement Abser

    fmt.Println(a.Abs())
}

e.g.
type error interface {
    Error() string
}

I don't know how to write a Reader of a Reader.
Let me write it out.
A io stream requires a Reader and a Writer
You read, do something, and write.

Time
start := time.Now()
time.Since(start)
time.Hour

I feel like Interface is the key to large scale GO programming.
How we abstract data types and actions, without an object.
URL: http://jordanorelli.tumblr.com/post/32665860244/how-to-use-interfaces-in-go

type Animal interface {
     Speak () string
}

type Dog struct {}
type Fish struct {}

?can a dog Speak?
?can a fish Speak?
Wait, we have to see whether
func (d Dog) Speak () string {}

func main() {
    animals := []Animal{Dog{}, Cat{}, Llama{}, JavaProgrammer{}}
    for _, animal := range animals {
        fmt.Println(animal.Speak())
    }
}

What has interface achieved here?
You want to treat the data equally (same action/function)
you want to have the same 'interface' or you kind of force yourself into agree
with certain constraints -- or types. You agree that every THING has a type.
You can use type system to check them at COMPILE time.



Well, here is the link to Russ Cox's
http://research.swtch.com/interfaces
It's a bit old, 2009. I don't know how much has changed.


Function types and closure
http://jordanorelli.tumblr.com/post/42369331748/function-types-in-go-golang
Generally you want to save it to a variable, stick it in a data
structure, or pass it to another function. It’s fairly common to see
this type of thing hanging out in Go code:

fn := func() {
    fmt.Println("hello")
}


Random numbers: rand.Seed, rand.Intn
rand.Seed(time.Now().Unix())
type binFunc func(int,int) int
fns := []binFunc{
    func(x,y int) int { return x + y}
}
fn := fns[rand.Intn(len(fns))]

Functions as Field in a struct
type op struct {
     name string
     fn func(int,int) int
}

ops := []op{
    {"add", func(x,y int) int {return x + y}}}

O := ops[rand.Intn(len(ops))]
fmt.Println(o.name, x, y, o.fn(x,y))

Functions as stored in maps
map[string]binFunc

Function recursive!
type walkFn func(*int) walkFn

In Go, any type that has an Error() string method is a valid error type, so
our function can serve as both a function and an error.

One more pieces of Go interfaces
URL: http://www.airs.com/blog/archives/277
In Go, the word interface is overloaded to mean several different things.
Every type has an interface, which is the set of methods defined for that type.
e.g.,
type S struct { i int}
func (p *S) Get() int { return p.i }
func (p *S) Put(v int) {p.i = v }

You can also define an interface type, which is simply a set of methods.
type I interface {
     Get() int
     Put(int)
}

S is a valid implementation for I, because it defines the two methods
which I requires. Note there is no explicit declaration that s implements I.

SKIP the boring details of implementation, we concluded that
Go combines interface values, static type checking, dynamic runtime
conversion, and no requirement for explicitly declaring that
a type satisfies an interface.

For example, one of the “controversial”† aspects of Go is that it uses
case to specify visibility. Instead of having a system of public,
private, and shared class members, visibility is at the level of the
package. Lowercase names like var a are visible only from the current
package, but uppercase names like var A are publicly visible, and so
on for types, functions, struct members, methods, etc. It is
blisteringly obvious in hindsight that enforcing visibility at the
package level instead of the class level is the right way to do it.

Another example of Go’s modernity is the decision to make the
directory the fundamental unit of packaging. While you can just
compile and run an individual file using go run filename.go, Go
encourages you to set the environmental variable $GOPATH and then put
your projects into $GOPATH/src/projectname/. When you run go install
project, it will compile that directory and put the executable into
$GOPATH/bin/. Why is this useful? It leads to a couple of nice
advantages. First, since it’s done by directory, you can make each
package you write its own git (or whatever) repository. Second, if
your project file gets too long, you can break it up into multiple
files that automatically get stitched into one at compile time. Not a
big deal, but nice. Third, there’s no need for something like Python’s
virtualenv. If you need to have different versions of the same library
installed simultaneously for two different projects, just switch
between two different $GOPATHs. Fourth, there’s no question of
Python’s relative import headaches. Imports are always either rooted
in $GOPATH/src/ or in the built-ins ($GOROOT/src/pkg/).


Go is rad. It’s not my everyday language (that’s still Python), but
it’s definitely a fun language to use, and one that would be great for
doing big projects in. If you’re interested in learning about Go, I
recommend doing the tour then reading the spec while you put test
programs into the Playground. The spec is very short and quite
readable, so it’s great way to learn Go.

What a wonderful day of Learning Go?

Rob Pike's Go at Google talk (2012)
http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.slide#60

What is Go?
concurrent:
garbage-collected:
efficient:
scalable:

Go was designed by and for people who write, read and debug
large software systems.
uncontrolled dependencies
language complexity
poor program understanding (documentation)

Primary design of Go
roughly C-like

Unused 'stuff' cause error at compile time
e.g., import only 'exported' vs. #include

No circular imports
it may cause 'occasional minor pain', however great
reduction in annoyance overall.

'structural typing' again

Package combines properties of library, name space, and module.
package json

Remote packages
 Can be a file, can be a URL:
go get github.com/4ad/doozer   // Command to fetch package
import "github.com/4ad/doozer" // Doozer client's import statement
var client doozer.Conn         // Client's use of package

Go aims for clean syntax
name before type  type T struct {a, b int}
easier to parse, no symbol table needed


Function syntax

Function on type T:

         func Abs(t T) float64

Method of type T:

       func (t T) Abs() float64

Variable (closure) of type T:

         negAbs := func(t T) float64 { return -Abs(t) }

In Go, functions can return multiple values. Common case: error.

   func ReadByte() (c byte, err error)

   c, err := ReadByte()
   if err != nil { ... }

More about errors later.


??? why he said 'variable (closure) of type T?'


Export syntax is easy: upper case initial letter.


Scope: universe, package, file(for imports only), function, block

Not in C:
concurrency
garbage collection: day 1 decision
interface types: composition not inheritance
reflection
type switches


Go is object-oriented
Go does not have classes or subtype inheritance
What does this mean?

In Go an interface is 'just' a set of methods.
type Hash interface {
     Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
     Sum(b []byte) []byte
     Reset()
     Size() int
     BlockSize() int
}

type Reader interface {
     Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
Reader (plus the complementary Writer) makes it easy to chain. [Explain]

I searched for rob pike and get to know Acme, Plan 9 etc.
http://rob.pike.usesthis.com/ The world should provide me my computing
environment and maintain it for me and make it available everywhere.

Read books (sample chapter) of Go standard library.
It comes with source code.
{files needs to be linked to anything I refer to.
In a superlinked work, imagine that the files/links to the 'S3'
as an object}
e.g., code is link to github
If everything is on the web (local disk will die!)

https://github.com/darkhelmet/go-thestdlib

Read and practiced chapter on tar/zip.
How can we make a pipeline chaining multiple streams?

You cracked the code! :)
the secret is the b.r.Read()

I still can't wrap around the 'interface'.
Is it mainly for 'static type checking'? so that at compile time,
the compiler will err when the type don't conform to the interface?
So interface is a contract?

I will write a rot13 derot13 to test the pipeline.
Yes. it works. Now, the mistry is that I only implemented a Read function.
How does it write to the os.Stdout or the next in the io stream?

Writing this within acme, a integrated development environment.
Text is so important for our communication and understanding,
discussion of ideas.

Let me read Rob Pike's paper on acme and see what else we can do with it.

Russ Cox also mentioned  to associate file types with applications.


This kind of helps creating a working script for any work done, right?







Learning Go is a book written by Miek Gieben
(It will be great for a site like 4clojure)

Given a program, how can you identify the keywords?
(I guess one way is to identify it by frequency from
different code bases written by different people.
It may miss the rarely used keywords though.)

Oh, I found the text package and scan.Scanner do the jobs for me.

There must be a Go interpret to make learning easier.


type File struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}

// File represents an open file descriptor.
type File struct {
     *file
}

// file is the real representation of *File.
// The extra level of indirection ensures that no clients of os
// can overwrite this data, which could cause the finalizer
// to close the wrong file descriptor.
type file struct {
     fd      int
     name    string
     dirinfo *dirInfo // nil unless directory being read
     nepipe  int32    // number of consecutive EPIPE in Write
                             }
File processing with Go
Flesh and meat

for read access,
    file, err := os.Open("filename")
    if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }


return fmt.Errorf("failed %s", err)
log.Fatal(err)
log.Fatalf("failed %s", err)



I always forgot to add package name, e.g., os.O_WRONLY,
I still treat import as pulling in all the exported names such that
no prefix is needed.

io.Copy is doing magic here:
I say io.Copy(to, from)
to and from are nothing but two File struct, which implements Read/write?

// Copy copies from src to dst until either EOF is reached
// on src or an error occurs.  It returns the number of bytes
// copied and the first error encountered while copying, if any.
//
// A successful Copy returns err == nil, not err == EOF.
// Because Copy is defined to read from src until EOF, it does
// not treat an EOF from Read as an error to be reported.
//
// If dst implements the ReaderFrom interface,
// the copy is implemented by calling dst.ReadFrom(src).
// Otherwise, if src implements the WriterTo interface,
// the copy is implemented by calling src.WriteTo(dst).

Woo, I can use Acme (Macbook pro touchpad, select and touch fingers touch to copy,
select and option to cut, fun)

To fully understand the rot13, tian example, read io.go


= vs :=
_, err := io.Copy(to,from)
: no new variables on left side of :=


wooooooooooo, it works, the tokenizer (see word.go ) text/scanner works wonders!

At first, I used s.Scan, however it return type rune, and I need string.
TokenText or TokenString

// TokenString returns a printable string for a token or Unicode character.
func TokenString(tok rune) string {
     if s, found := tokenString[tok]; found {
        return s
        }
        return fmt.Sprintf("%q", string(tok))
}


I used TokenString and guess what happens:
String: 6
"=": 8
"[": 2
...


where are all the strings?!

To know the details of TokenText, read scanner.go

Peek the internals of a computation?

I found an interesting code snippet in bzip2.go
This implements a custom error type and its error message.

type StructuralError string

func (s StructuralError) Error() string {
     return "bzip2 data invalid: " + string(s)
     }
return StructuralError("non-Huffman entropy encoding")


     buf       []byte    // stores Burrows-Wheeler transformed data.
     well, []byte declaration?

copy is select/control;
cut is select/option


Magic number?
const bzip2FileMagic = 0x425a // "BZ"
const bzip2BlockMagic = 0x314159265359
const bzip2FinalMagic = 0x177245385090

Go nuts now 1.1beta1
URL: http://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.1

last return is not necessary if

ReadLine, ReadBytes, ReadString in the bufio
now we have a simpifier : Scanner (we see the scanner in the Text package?)

scanner := bufio.NewScanner (os.Stdin)
for scanner.Scan() {
    fmt.Println(scanner.Text() )
}

if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
   fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "reading standard input:", err)
}

I shall study the codes in
http://tip.golang.org/pkg/bufio/#example_Scanner_custom

scanner.Split(a_function)
e.g.
scanner.Split(bufio.ScanWords)

Browse the pkg, find strings:  TrimPrefix and TrimSuffix
HasSuffix : .bam  if strings.HasSuffix("hel.bam", ".bam")  {}
Index : Index("/hello/world/t.bam", "/")
Join: Join(s, "\t")

?how about string1+string2?
yes, it works.


Woo, Look at this
func main(){
        s := regexp.MustCompile(`ESP=([\.\d]+);`)
        m := s.FindString("A=123;ESP=0.04;KG=0.1")
        fmt.Println(m)
}


raw string to avoid having to quote the backslashes




April 5, 2013
I also see using "errors"
err := errors.New("A specific error message")
which can be a separate file in errors.go


config file: I will try json first.
TODO: learn to work with json  "encoding json"
well, so easy, just to
var conf config
json.Unmarshal(file_contents, & conf)

JSON and Go JavaScript Object Notation
e.g., http://json.org/
object :     { key1:value1, key2:value2, }
array  :     [ value1, value2, ]
value  :     string, number, object, array, true, false, null

*** type assertion
i.(type)

Quite interesting to work with interface{}
f.(map[string]interface{})



Read all from a small file to []byte:
it is a general function to slurp file into memory
and later on other functions to parse
func readFile(path string) (contents []byte, err error) {
	file, err := os.Open(path)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	reader := bufio.NewReader(file)

	contents, err = ioutil.ReadAll(reader)
	return
}

Finished Chap 2 of Shiwei Xu's Go book.
I skipped the bubblesort and quicksort though. 
Acme is pretty cool!
